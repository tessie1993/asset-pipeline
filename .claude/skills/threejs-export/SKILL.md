# Blender Three.js Export

Exports the current Blender scene as a compressed GLB and generates a standalone HTML file with a Three.js viewer. The viewer includes orbit controls, studio lighting, auto-rotation, and responsive sizing — ready to drop into any website.

## Prerequisites

- **Blender** (4.x+) running with the **Blender MCP addon** active on port 9876
- A scene loaded in Blender (e.g. after running `blender-product-polish`)

## How to Run

```bash
node skills/blender-threejs-export/scripts/blender-threejs-export.js --output ~/Desktop/my-product
```

### Options

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `--output` | Output directory for the GLB + HTML files | **required** |
| `--name` | File name (without extension) | `model` |
| `--port` | Blender MCP port | `9876` |
| `--no-rotate` | Disable auto-rotation | `false` |
| `--bg` | Background color hex | `#111111` |
| `--embed` | Base64-embed the GLB into the HTML (single file) | `false` |

## Output

```
output-dir/
  model.glb          # Compressed GLB export from Blender
  model.html         # Standalone Three.js viewer (CDN imports, no build step)
```

## Viewer Features

- **Orbit controls** — click and drag to rotate, scroll to zoom, right-click to pan
- **Auto-rotation** — slow spin to showcase the product (disable with `--no-rotate`)
- **Studio lighting** — 3-point light setup matching the Blender polish look
- **Responsive** — fills container, works on mobile
- **Zero dependencies** — uses Three.js from CDN via import maps, no npm/build needed
- **Drop-in ready** — open the HTML directly or embed in any page
